Now the setup is ready for deployment. The server will serve the built Vite app from client/dist, and all API requests will be handled correctly.
For deployment on Render:
Point to the root directory
Use "npm install && npm run build && npm start" as the build command
The app will run on the port provided by the hosting environment
